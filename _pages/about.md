Currently I am the academic director of the Msc in Data Science and an <a
href="https://faculty.itam.mx/facultad/108727-alfredo-garbuno-inigo">assistant
professor</a> at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM). I teach
courses for the Department of Statistics and the masters programme in Data
Science at ITAM.

My research interests gravitate around Bayesian inverse problems, data
assimilation, nonparametric Bayesian methods, stochastic processes, and
stochastic differential equations. Part of my research has been developed and
incorporated on the project of the Climate Modeling Alliance <a
href="https://clima.caltech.edu/">(CliMA)</a>. My contribution to the project
regards data assimilation and uncertainty quantification for complex
simulators. This is a very common endeavor that can be encountered in broad
engineering applications.

### Academic Background


<div align="justify">

I was a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology
(Caltech) during 2018-2020. It was a dual position in the Computing
and Mathematical Siences (CMS) and the Environmental Science and
Engineering (ESE) departments.

I received my PhD from the University of Liverpool while doing
research at the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty + School of
Engineering. My dissertation focused on non-parametric Bayesian
Statistics in computer code analysis driven by Gaussian processes,
Bayesian inference and automatic calibration. I obtained my Masters in
Data Science at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México). I
have a Bachelor degree in both Applied Mathematics and Actuarial
Sciences.
