Currently I am the Advanced Analytics Discipline Leader at BBVA Mexico. Formerly, I was the academic director of the Msc in Data Science and an
<a
href="https://faculty.itam.mx/facultad/108727-alfredo-garbuno-inigo">assistant
professor</a> at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM). I
taught courses for the Department of Statistics and the masters program
in Data Science at ITAM. I currently hold an appointment at level 1 by
the National System of Research (SNI) from Mexico's National Council
of Science and Technology (CONACyT). I have also been elected as
member of the Board of Directors for the Latin American Regional
Section (LARS) of the International Association for Statistical
Computing (<a href="https://iasc-isi.org/lars-mission/">IASC</a>).

<br>

My main line of research is on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) which
typically involves computationally expensive computer codes that are
run on high performance computing environments. My research also deals
with algorithmic approximations and their theoretical analysis in
order to properly quantify related uncertainties. Overall my areas of
expertise are Bayesian inference, Bayesian Inverse problems, Data
Assimilation, Predictive Modeling, Resampling methods, and, lately,
Conformal predictions. Part of my research has been developed and
incorporated on the project of the Climate Modeling Alliance <a
href="https://clima.caltech.edu/">(CliMA)</a>.

<br>

I am advocate of modern computing technologies. I am particularly proud of 
incorporating remote computing environments
for my students at both undergraduate and graduate leves. These
computing environments are set in such a way that mimics the typical infrastructure available for Big Data
applications. My opinion is that these skills are a necessity for the
new generation of statistics--oriented and --assisted research. I believe
these particularities are shaping the future of Statistics as a modern
discipline.

### Academic Background


<div align="justify">

I was a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology
(Caltech) during 2018-2020. It was a dual position in the Computing
and Mathematical Siences (CMS) and the Environmental Science and
Engineering (ESE) departments.

I received my PhD from the University of Liverpool while doing
research at the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty + School of
Engineering. My dissertation focused on non-parametric Bayesian
Statistics in computer code analysis driven by Gaussian processes,
Bayesian inference and automatic calibration. I obtained my Masters in
Data Science at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México). I
have a Bachelor degree in both Applied Mathematics and Actuarial
Sciences.
