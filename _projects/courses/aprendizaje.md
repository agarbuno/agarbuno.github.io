## Objectives

Statistical Learning is about how to establish association rules by
looking at data. In this course we study the fundamental ideas behind
modern statistical learning techniques and incorporate familiar
concepts from previous Statistics courses. 

The course is intended for the bachelors programs in Applied
Mathematics, Data Science and Actuarial Sciences at ITAM. Nonetheless,
I have had the pleasure of teaching students from other disciplines such 
as Economy and Political Science. 

In general, the book of James, et al <d-cite key="James2021"></d-cite> is used as a
textbook for this course.
