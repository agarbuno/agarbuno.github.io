## Objectives 

This course aims to introduce to the students the fundamentals of
statistics through the use of computational tools. We motivate the
formulation of statistical inference (point estimates, interval
estimates and hypothesis testing) as part of the endeavors an applied
statistician is going to solve in their professional career. That is,
we motivate statistics in the context of decision-making under
uncertainty.


We cover frequentist statistics with the help of resampling techniques
in order to motivate the clear distinction of the assumptions under
this framework.  Later on, we cover the basics of Bayesian inference
under a decision making process.

The course is followed up by the course in [bayesian
modeling](bayesiana.md) where specifics on probabilistic programming
and approximate methods are studied in the context of inference and
machine learning.
 

## Acknowledgments

This course co-developed with [Teresa
Ortiz](https://github.com/tereom) and [Felipe
Gonzalez](https://github.com/felipegonzalez). It has been instructed
for the Msc in Data Science, Msc in Computational Sciences and Msc in
Applied Economics. Lecture notes are available [here (in
Spanish)](https://fundamentos-est-2021.netlify.app/).
