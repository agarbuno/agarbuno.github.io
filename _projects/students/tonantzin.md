In this project, different classification models were built using
machine and deep learning architectures. The classification task was
done to newspaper articles and social media posts in Spanish whose
subjects vary but mainly refer to Latin American national politics and
the current coronavirus crisis. The purpose of the models built was
detecting when a text constitutes fake, true or misleading news. Due
to the modelsâ€™ input, Natural Language Processing was studied.
