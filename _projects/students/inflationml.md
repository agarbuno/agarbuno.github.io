## Summary


Different predictive models are applied to a collection of several
time-series of national and international macroeconomic variables. The
basis of this research results from the desire to push further the
work of almost 10 years in inflation analysis performed at the Central
Bank.

## Contributions

In order to pursue clarity on the predictive capabilities of the
trained models Luz' work include post-fitting analysis on feature
contributions by means of SHAP values <d-cite
