In this work an approximate Bayesian approach for Deep Learning is
compared with a conventional approach, all within a context of Active
Learning. The conventional approach is based on the optimization of a
loss function, which results in a single point estimate with no
measure of uncertainty. An approximate Bayesian method is used for
computational feasibility. 

A comparison is made under three datasets in a computer vision setting
where labeled data points are actively chosen. The results show that
choosing points under the model uncertainty is better than choosing at
random. However, there is no evidence that favors a variational
approximation over the frequentist methodology.
