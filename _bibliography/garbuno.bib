abstract = {This dissertation examines the use of non-parametric Bayesian methods and advanced Monte Carlo algorithms for the emulation and reliability analysis of complex engineering computations. Firstly, the problem lies in the reduction of the computational cost of such models and the generation of posterior samples for the Gaussian Process’ (GP) hyperparameters. In a GP, as the flexibility of the mechanism to induce correlations among training points increases, the number of hyperparameters increases as well. This leads to multimodal posterior distributions. Typical variants of MCMC samplers are not designed to overcome multimodality. Maximum posterior estimates of hyperparameters, on the other hand, do not guarantee a global optimiser. This presents a challenge when emulating expensive simulators in light of small data. Thus, new MCMC algorithms are presented which allow the use of full Bayesian emulators by sampling from their respective multimodal posteriors. Secondly, in order for these complex models to be reliable, they need to be robustly calibrated to experimental data. History matching solves the calibration problem by discarding regions of input parameters space. This allows one to determine which configurations are likely to replicate the observed data. In particular, the GP surrogate model’s probabilistic statements are exploited, and the data assimilation process is improved. Thirdly, as sampling- based methods are increasingly being used in engineering, variants of sampling algorithms in other engineering tasks are studied, that is reliability-based methods. Several new algorithms to solve these three fundamental problems are proposed, developed and tested in both illustrative examples and industrial-scale models.},

  abstract={Surrogate models have become ubiquitous in science and engineering for their capability of emulating expensive computer codes, necessary to model and investigate complex phenomena. Bayesian emulators based on Gaussian processes adequately quantify the uncertainty that results from the cost of the original simulator, and thus the inability to evaluate it on the whole input space. However, it is common in the literature that only a partial Bayesian analysis is carried out, whereby the underlying hyper-parameters are estimated via gradient-free optimisation or genetic algorithms, to name a few methods. On the other hand, maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation could discard important regions of the hyper-parameter space. In this paper, we carry out a more complete Bayesian inference, that combines Slice Sampling with some recently developed Sequential Monte Carlo samplers. The resulting algorithm improves the mixing in the sampling through delayed-rejection, the inclusion of an annealing scheme akin to Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling and parallelisation via Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Examples related to the estimation of Gaussian process hyper-parameters are presented.},

  abstract = {Gaussian process emulators of computationally expensive computer codes provide fast statistical approximations to model physical processes. The training of these surrogates depends on the set of design points chosen to run the simulator. Due to computational cost, such training set is bound to be limited and quantifying the resulting uncertainty in the hyper-parameters of the emulator by uni-modal distributions is likely to induce bias. In order to quantify this uncertainty, this paper proposes a computationally efficient sampler based on an extension of Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling, a recently developed algorithm for Bayesian inference. Structural uncertainty of the emulator is obtained as a by-product of the Bayesian treatment of the hyper-parameters. Additionally, the user can choose to perform stochastic optimisation to sample from a neighbourhood of the Maximum a Posteriori estimate, even in the presence of multimodality. Model uncertainty is also acknowledged through numerical stabilisation measures by including a nugget term in the formulation of the probability model. The efficiency of the proposed sampler is illustrated in examples where multi-modal distributions are encountered.},

  abstract = {Identifying the parameters of a model and rating competitive models based on measured data has been among the most important but challenging topics in modern science and engineering, with great potential of application in structural system identification, updating and development of high fidelity models. These problems in principle can be tackled using a Bayesian probabilistic approach, where the parameters to be identified are treated as uncertain and their inference information are given in terms of their posterior (i.e., given data) probability distribution. For complex models encountered in applications, efficient computational tools robust to the number of uncertain parameters in the problem are required for computing the posterior statistics, which can generally be formulated as a multi-dimensional integral over the space of the uncertain parameters. Subset Simulation (SuS) has been developed for solving reliability problems involving complex systems and it is found to be robust to the number of uncertain parameters. An analogy has been recently established between a Bayesian updating problem and a reliability problem, which opens up the possibility of efficient solution by SuS. The formulation, called BUS (Bayesian Updating with Structural reliability methods), is based on conventional rejection principle. Its theoretical correctness and efficiency requires the prudent choice of a multiplier, which has remained an open question. Motivated by the choice of the multiplier and its philosophical role, this paper presents a study of BUS. The work leads to a revised formulation that resolves the issues regarding the multiplier so that SuS can be implemented without knowing the multiplier. Examples are presented to illustrate the theory and applications. },
