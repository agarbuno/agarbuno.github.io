  Abstract				= {Surrogate models have become ubiquitous in science and engineering for their capability of emulating expensive computer codes, necessary to model and investigate complex phenomena. Bayesian emulators based on Gaussian processes adequately quantify the uncertainty that results from the cost of the original simulator, and thus the inability to evaluate it on the whole input space. However, it is common in the literature that only a partial Bayesian analysis is carried out, whereby the underlyig hyper-parameters are estimated via gradient-free optimisation or genetic algorithms, to name a few methods. On the other hand, maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation could discard important regions of the hyper-parameter space. In this paper, we carry out a more complete Bayesian inference, through combining Slice Sampling with some recently developed Sequential Monte Carlo samplers. The resulting algorithm improves the mixing in the sampling through delayed-rejection, the inclusion of an annealing scheme akin to Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling and parallelisation via Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Examples related to the estimation of hyper-parameters, as well as examples applied in other contexts of Bayesian inference, are presented.},

  Title                    = {{Gaussian process hyper-parameter estimation using parallel asymptotically independent Markov sampling}},
  Abstract                 = {Gaussian process surrogates of computationally expensive computer codes provide fast statistical approximations to model physical processes. The training of these surrogates depends on the set of design points chosen to run the expensive simulator. However, such training set is bound to be limited and quantifying the resulting uncertainty in the hyper-parameters of the emulator by uni-modal distributions is likely to induce bias. This paper proposes a computationally efficient sampler based on an extension of the Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling, a recently developed algorithm for Bayesian inference and extended to optimisation problems. Structural uncertainty of the emulator is obtained as a by-product of the Bayesian treatment of the hyper-parameters. Model uncertainty is also acknowledged through numerical stabilisation measures by including a nugget term in the formulation of the probability model. The efficiency of the proposed sampler is illustrated in examples where multi-modal distributions are encountered.},
