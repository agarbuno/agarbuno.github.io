# Profile 

<div align="justify">
I am a Phd Student in the Insitutue for Risk and Uncertainty in the University
of Liverpool. I am a graduate of the Masters in Data Science at ITAM (Instituto
Tecnológico Autónomo de México). I have a Bachelor degree in both Applied
Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences. During the last semester of the MSc
programme I taught an undergraduate course in Numerical Methods and during my
Bachelor studies I was a tutor in the Statistic’s Department at ITAM. The latter
being as a TA in the UK system. My passion lies whithin large scale applications
of mathematical optimization which can be encountered in machine learning
algorithms and statistical models’ solutions. I have vast expertise in numerical
methods, statistical modelling, data visualization and applied probability.
Currently, my research lies in the statistical analysis of computationally
expensive computer codes through stochastic surrogates. My aim is to become an
active social data scientist to contribute mathematical tools towards society.
