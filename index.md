## Profile

<div align="justify">

Currently I am a postdoctoral scholar at California Institute of Technology
(Caltech), in a joint research project between the Department of Computing +
Mathematical Sciences (CMS), and the Division of Geological and Planetary
Systems (GPS). My research focuses on Uncertainty Quantification for complex
simulators as the ones encountered in climate modeling and engineering
applications. My research interests gravitate around Bayesian inverse problems,
stochastic processes, numerical analysis, and both stochastic and deterministic
partial differential equations. I am also interested in large scale applications
of mathematical models, often encountered in numerical optimisation and pattern
recognition tasks as in machine learning. As a professional, I have specialised
in numerical methods, statistical modelling, data visualisation and applied
probability models.

### Academic Background

<div align="justify">

I received my PhD from the University of Liverpool while doing research at the
Institute for Risk and Uncertainty + School of Engineering. My dissertation
focused on non-parametric Bayesian Statistics in computer code analysis driven by Gaussian processes, Bayesian inference and automatic calibration. I obtained my Masters in Data Science at ITAM
(Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México). I have a Bachelor degree in both
Applied Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences. My teaching experience has been in
undergraduate-level courses in Numerical Methods, as well as a tutor in the
Statistic’s Department at ITAM. The latter being as a TA in the UK system. I have been a Teaching Assistant in both Engineering and Computer
Science departments in UoL, such as in object oriented programming, MATLAB
programming for engineers and database management.

## About this site

This site was build using both [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), a theme
which provides a fully furnished [Jekyll]() setup, and [Jekyll-
scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) a cool plugin for
academic-oriented blogs (though a pain for [github](http://github.com)
pages). It is inspired by the amazing [Michael A
Osborne's](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/) customization of Hyde's
environment.
