## Profile

<div align="justify">

Currently I am the academic director of the Msc in Data Science and an <a
href="https://faculty.itam.mx/facultad/108727-alfredo-garbuno-inigo">assistant
professor</a> at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM). I teach
courses for the Department of Statistics and the masters programme in Data
Science at ITAM.

My research interests gravitate around Bayesian inverse problems, data
assimilation, nonparametric Bayesian methods, stochastic processes, and
stochastic differential equations. Part of my research has been developed and
incorporated on the project of the Climate Modeling Alliance <a
href="https://clima.caltech.edu/">(CliMA)</a>. My contribution in the project is
aimed towards data assimilation and uncertainty quantification for complex
simulators. This is a very common endeavor that can be encountered in broad
engineering applications.

<!---I am driven by large scale applications of mathematical models, often
encountered in numerical optimisation and pattern recognition tasks as in
machine learning. As a professional, I have specialised in numerical methods,
statistical modelling, data visualisation and applied probability models.--->

### Academic Background


<div align="justify">

I received my PhD from the University of Liverpool while doing research at the
Institute for Risk and Uncertainty + School of Engineering. My dissertation
focused on non-parametric Bayesian Statistics in computer code analysis driven
by Gaussian processes, Bayesian inference and automatic calibration. I obtained
my Masters in Data Science at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México). I
have a Bachelor degree in both Applied Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences.

### About this site

This site was build using both [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), a theme
which provides a fully furnished [Jekyll]() setup, and [Jekyll-
scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) a cool plugin for
academic-oriented blogs (though a pain for [github](http://github.com)
pages). It is inspired by the amazing [Michael A
Osborne's](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/) customization of Hyde's
environment.
