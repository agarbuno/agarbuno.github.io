## Profile (*update coming soon...*)

<div align="justify">

Currently I am a Phd Student in the Insitutue for Risk and Uncertainty at the
University of Liverpool. I obtained my Masters in Data Science at ITAM
(Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México). I have a Bachelor degree in both
Applied Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences. My teaching experience has been in
undergraduate-level courses in Numerical Methods, as well as a tutor in the
Statistic’s Department at ITAM. The latter being as a TA in the UK system. More
recently, I have been a Teaching Assistant in both Engineering and Computer
Science departments in UoL, such as in object oriented programming, MATLAB
programming for engineers and database management. I am interested in large
scale applications of mathematical models, often encountered in numerical
optimisation and pattern recognition tasks related to machine learning. As a
professional I have specialised in numerical methods, statistical modelling,
data visualisation and applied probability models. My current research lies
within the domain of non-parametric Bayesian Statistics in computer code
analysis and the extension of such models for Numerical Optimisation and
Statistical Learning.

## About this site

This site was build using both [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), a theme
which provides a fully furnished [Jekyll]() setup, and [Jekyll-
scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) a cool plugin for
academic-oriented blogs (though a pain for [github](http://github.com)
pages). It is inspired by the amazing [Michael A
Osborne's](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/) customization of Hyde's
environment.
