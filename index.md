## Profile

<div align="justify">

Currently I am an assistant professor at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de
México (ITAM). I teach courses for the Department of Statistics and the masters
programme in Data Science at ITAM. I collaborate on the project of the Climate
Modeling Alliance <a href="https://clima.caltech.edu/">(CliMA)</a>, in which I
am contributing towards Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification for
complex simulators as the ones encountered in climate modeling and broad
engineering applications. My research interests gravitate around Bayesian
inverse problems, nonparametric inference, stochastic processes, and numerical
analysis.

<!---I am driven by large scale applications of mathematical models, often
encountered in numerical optimisation and pattern recognition tasks as in
machine learning. As a professional, I have specialised in numerical methods,
statistical modelling, data visualisation and applied probability models.--->

### Academic Background


<div align="justify">

I received my PhD from the University of Liverpool while doing research at the
Institute for Risk and Uncertainty + School of Engineering. My dissertation
focused on non-parametric Bayesian Statistics in computer code analysis driven
by Gaussian processes, Bayesian inference and automatic calibration. I obtained
my Masters in Data Science at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México). I
have a Bachelor degree in both Applied Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences. My
teaching experience has been in undergraduate-level courses in Numerical
Methods, as well as a tutor in the Statistic’s Department at ITAM. The latter
being as a TA in the UK system. I have been a Teaching Assistant in both
Engineering and Computer Science departments in UoL, such as in object oriented
programming, MATLAB programming for engineers and database management.

### About this site

This site was build using both [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), a theme
which provides a fully furnished [Jekyll]() setup, and [Jekyll-
scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) a cool plugin for
academic-oriented blogs (though a pain for [github](http://github.com)
pages). It is inspired by the amazing [Michael A
Osborne's](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/) customization of Hyde's
environment.
